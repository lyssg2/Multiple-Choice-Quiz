# Multiple-Choice-Quiz

The purpose of this project was to make a multiple choice quiz on the topic of Javascript. The user is timed and scores are kept to try to get the highest score.

## Description

To take the quiz, the user must read the instructions, and when ready, can press the "start" button. Upon start, the timer will begin its countdown and the user must select an answer by clicking on whichever they choose. The program will indicate if the answer is right or wrong. If the answer is wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. After all questions have been asked, the user will be told how many points they recieved from each correct answer. The user will then have the opportunity to submit their initials for the highscore board and play again if they wish.

## Getting Started

Required program(s) needed is any common internet browser with Javascript enabled in said browser (most browsers already have them installed and enabled).
